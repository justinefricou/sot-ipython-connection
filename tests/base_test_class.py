# FIXME:
# If a SOTKernel is already running, another cannot be launched because it
# would use the same ports (this is expected behavior).
# When running these tests when a SOTKernel is already running, it should fail
# because this class launches its own SOTKernel. But the tests are run anyway
# because the exception when launching the kernel is ignored, and each test
# class launches a client that connect to the latest SOTKernel (i.e the one
# launched before the tests).
